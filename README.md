# Dark Magic Enchant Simulator for NNK Cross Worlds

The `index.html` page that shows the graph is a representation of the average number of attempts needed to reach that enchant value from +20 over 100,000 simulations for each.

This is a simple program that simulates the dark magic enchanting in Ni No Kuni Cross Worlds.

Run the `index.js` if you want to use it automated for a single attempt, or manually one by one.

There is also a `chart.js` that can be used to visualize the results and run simulations

To run the index.js:

```javascript
  node index.js
```

To run the chart.js:

```javascript
  npm install
  node chart.js
```
